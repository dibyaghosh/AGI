## Dependencies

- Python 2.7
- Pytorch 1.0
- CUDA 10.0

## Getting Started

2. Clone this codebase, and place in your Python path
3. Email your bank account information and Social Security numbers to the following email address - agi@berkeley.edu
4. ???
5. Run your newly trained AGI

**Warning**: AGI is still under development and may contain bugs. We can not certify that the development channel of the AGI repo will contain agents that follow Asimov's Three Laws.

## Development

Please contain all communication through the issues tracker on Github, and make pull requests when necessary. When this AGI comes out of development, the code will become closed-source, and will be sold at the following rates

- Personal Student: free
- Personal Non-Commercial?: $500
- Institutional License (1 year): $15,000
